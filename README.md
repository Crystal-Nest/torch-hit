# Torch hit!
### Deal fire aspect with torches!

## Features
- Hit with a torch in your main hand to deal fire aspect!
- Hit with a tool in your main hand and a torch in your off hand to deal fire aspect!
- Configurable! See next section for more details.

## Configuration
- By default direct (main hand) torch hits deal Fire Aspect I for its full duration.  
  Fire Aspect level and duration can be configured.
- By default indirect (off hand) torch hits are enabled and work with any tool, dealing Fire Aspect I for half its duration.  
  Fire Aspect level, duration, tool list and whether enabling this feature can all be configured.
- By default soul torches and regular torches behave the same.  
  This can be changed, allowing each kind of torch to deal more or less damage to specific group of entities.
