### Deal fire aspect with torches!

## Features
- Hit with a torch in your main hand to deal fire aspect!
- Hit with a tool in your main hand and a torch in your off hand to deal fire aspect!
- Configurable! See next section for more details.

## Configuration
- By default direct (main hand) torch hits deal fire damage for 4 seconds.  
  The duration can be configured.
- By default indirect (off hand) torch hits are enabled and work with any tool, dealing fire damage for 2 seconds.
